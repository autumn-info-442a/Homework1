## 1. How will you coordinate your work?
### Who will coordinate the work? 
Our teamâ€™s Project Manager will continue to lead coordinating how our work is assigned. During our team meetings we will discuss as a team what work needs to be done and agree on who is responsible for what. After discussing as a team we feel that having our PM lead delegating work has been successful up to this point and as a four person team we do not need an additional PM for this project.
### What will their project management practices be?
We will continue to use the Agile project management methodologies with 1 week sprints. After discussing as a team we have decided to use Github issues for the remainder of this project, instead of Trello. This was a consensus in our team as we feel Github will be a more effective tool because our repository is already hosted on Github.
### Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?
In addition to class times, we will meet every Friday at 6:30pm. We can plan additional meetings outside of those times as needed but class time + Friday at 6:30pm are our set dates. The PM will plan the agendas for the team.

## 2. What tools will you use to communicate? For each, articulate the alternatives and why that is the best choice.
We will continue to use Zoom for our team meetings.
- Reliable video and screen sharing
- Sam has had issues with Discord this quarter
- We experience the least latency issues on Zoom compared to Discord
We will use Facebook Messenger to communicate outside of meetings.
Works internationally
- Everyone in the team is comfortable with it
- Reliable and available on both desktop and mobile
We will use Github Issues in order to track project milestones and issues
- Shares the same platform as where our code is hosted
- More programming specific than Trello
- Has more robust tools to work with code (i.e. raise issue on specific chunks)
- Teammates would like to learn how to use it

# How will you coordinate your work?
## Who will coordinate the work? 
Our teamâ€™s Project Manager will continue to lead coordinating how our work is assigned. During our team meetings we will discuss as a team what work needs to be done and agree on who is responsible for what. After discussing as a team we feel that having our PM lead delegating work has been successful up to this point and as a four person team we do not need an additional PM for this project.
## What will their project management practices be?
We will continue to use the Agile project management methodologies with 1 week sprints. After discussing as a team we have decided to use Github issues for the remainder of this project, instead of Trello. This was a consensus in our team as we feel Github will be a more effective tool because our repository is already hosted on Github.
## Will you have meetings? How frequently? Who plans their agendas?
In addition to class times, we will meet every Friday at 6:30pm. We can plan additional meetings outside of those times as needed but class time + Friday at 6:30pm are our set dates. The PM will plan the agendas for the team.

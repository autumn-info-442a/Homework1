# Homework 2: Design

* Problem (1 point). Full credit for something that is logically sound and clearly defined.

In the United States, 60% of parents use YouTube as a tool for babysitting their children (ages 7-13) on at least a biweekly basis. This exposure is often unregulated, which poses risks of “binging” on content for extended periods of time. Research suggests that habitual consumption of YouTube content may lead to addiction and other psychological issues. YouTube Kids is an existing solution to some of these risks by removing comments and restricting videos shown. This approach to YouTube addiction is not effective because YouTube has a financial stake in designing its algorithm to promote high watch times to earn more revenue from ads. Parents have the option to remove all ads by purchasing YouTube Premium, which still fails to directly address the issues of YouTube addiction and self-regulation of watch time. In light of these risks associated with YouTube, what balance of parent intervention and platform moderation best promotes child safety and self regulation?  

* Details (3 point). Lose 0.25 points for every interactive detail that is critical to solving the problem that is not specified. It's okay if visual details are not specified, since those can be changed easily. I want to see the core functionality of your application fully specified.

* Strategy Feedback (1 point). Write a comment on HowToo evaluating the utility of the specification refinement strategy.  Remember that the comment must not be anonymous.

This section must detail every design decision necessary for engineering your solution, including every screen, every error, every algorithmic functionality, and every detail about the textual and visual content of your design (aside from content created by users). If your solution is software, a software engineer should be able to read your specification and build your solution without asking you any questions. Embed mockups of screens throughout the text of this section to visually specify your design. Because of the short timeline, it's okay if these are hand-sketched.
